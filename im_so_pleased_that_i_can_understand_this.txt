The Trowbridge-Reitz / GGX microfacet distribution describes the microsurface as being 
composed of perfectly specular, infinitesimal oblate ellipsoids, whose half-height in the 
normal direction is α times the radius in the tangent plane. α = 1 gives spheres, which 
results in uniform reflection in all directions. This reflection behavior corresponds to a 
rough surface. α = 0 gives a perfectly specular surface.
